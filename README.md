# todos-express-social-credential-management

This app illustrates how to use [Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/) with
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) to sign users in with [Google](https://www.google.com/),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/).  It
takes the [baseline example](https://github.com/passport/todos-express-social)
and extends it with [Credential Management](https://www.w3.org/TR/credential-management-1/),
allowing the browser to assist with the storage and selection of social network
accounts.  Use this example as a starting point for your own web applications.
